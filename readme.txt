== Tailored Recommendations for Your Website - Take the Plunge! ==

Your website isn't just the heart and soul of your business - it's a reflection on your brand. Ever since you created your site, you may think about improving and optimizing your site to make it better, get more traffic and increase clicks and conversions. However, knowing where to start can elude even the seasoned business veteran.

There are just too many things to do, from hosting, domain, website design, content writing, site security, site performance, email service, internet marketing to SEO...for many site owners, this is an added burden that cuts into their time spent delivering excellent customer service or thinking about new business plans. Fortunately, there's a solution out there that streamlines the whole process and makes it easy to optimise and maintain your website without sacrificing valuable attention better spent on developing your business. iClew Business Kit is an assistant that helps combine your goals of site improvement and optimization into one neat package.

How can all of these tasks be combined into one effective business solution? Below are some examples how iClew can help you optimize your site.

= Site Cache = 
Improving your site's access speed should be a top priority if you want to keep visitors (and potential customers) on your site. Your cache is a vital part of making sure that your website loads quickly, is responsive and remains accessible. When you consider increasing your site access speed, addressing any cache issues should be your top solution before you pay more for another hosting company or more bandwidth. Sadly, most website owners don't even think about this vital issue.

Caching is a means of storing web content such as webpages and images temporarily as statistic content. When many visitors access the same webpage or perform the same action, such as visiting a specific page, it doesn't need to send the same requests to your site server repeatedly. All this frequently-accessed content is cached on the server over time. When the cached content is accessed, it can be displayed almost instantaneously. That's why site caching increases your site speed and prevents the overload of your server. Optimizing your site in this way can lead to a higher number of conversions - something that's essential if you want to establish yourself online as the best in your field.

Enabling and improving the cache on your site takes time and effort, especially if you have a large site with scores of pages. If you want to work on your site's cache, then iClew can help you! iClew scans your site and checks to see if there is any cache mechanism on your site. If you don't have one, a tailored improvement recommendation for your site caching will be sent to you to help you enable site cache. You'll be rolling in increased pageviews in no time!

= Site Security = 
Any website is prone to security risks. Malware, spyware and viruses are a part of life in the digital age. Site security is always one of the top things you should consider ever since you build your site. You need to protect your database and your files. You need to prevent any attack to your server and website. Exposing your website and your data to hackers or phishers can cause your online reputation to suffer a critical hit. You're only as good as your weakest link, but do you have the time to sit down and figure out what your site needs in terms of safety and security?

iClew can help you by providing you with regular, custom-designed security recommendations that you can quickly and easily implement with a minimum of fuss and effort. You won't have to worry about hiring an IT expert or contracting with a company for exorbitant rates. With these website security recommendations, the tough task of keeping your website secure becomes much easier to manage. You can secure your website and focus on doing what you do best - running your website and your business.

= Site Backup =
No matter how secure or robust your site is, it is a good habit to back up your site periodically. Your site might be hacked or be deleted totally by mistake, or something could go wrong with your hosting company. Any downtime directly affects your bottom line and can quickly eat into your profit margins. You should be asking yourself the following questions on a regular basis:

What is your backup plan if the site goes down?
What should you back up and how often should you perform these backups?
Where should you back up the complete the copy of your website? Do you have a safe server behind a firewall?
Should you use manual or automated backup for your site?

If this all seems a bit too much for you to handle, that's where iClew can help. iClew can assist you and provide site backup recommendations for you based on your assessment of what your site needs to keep running smoothly at all times. Large or small, iClew can find a backup solution that works for you.

= SEO =
Everyone knows the importance of SEO - it's evolved from a buzzword to a solid science that directly affects your website's traffic. There's a wealth of information out there, but there's also a lot of bad advice. Take one wrong turn or listen to one wrong piece of advice and your website could be penalized and dropped to the bottom pages of Google.

There may be hundreds of methods to optimize your site for SEO - site structure, navigation, sitemap, images, URLs, content writing, social media. It's a continuous, systematic process to improve your website rank. It's easy to become focused on one aspect of SEO when a well-rounded approach is vital for the life of your business. Many website owners make the mistake of taking shortcuts, such as buying backlinks, that come back to haunt them later.

Again, iClew can provide you SEO recommendations day by day. Most of them are proven SEO methods and are easy to perform. You can just follow our tailored SEO recommendations and get more traffic to your site. You don't have to worry about meta tags, title tags or link juice - just keep doing what you're doing and let iClew handle the algorithm updates and long-tail search terms.

= Designing and Enhancing Mobile Versions of Your Site =
A recent Google study found that 79% of shoppers use their mobile devices to shop and make purchases. Obviously, more and more consumers are using their mobile devices to search for the products and services your business may offer. It's time for you to have a mobile version of your site if you haven't made the jump already. However, designing, testing and launching a mobile site can be a long and intensive process. If your hands are already full with your business, adding another aspect might feel overwhelming.

Shall you create a website that provides full functionality on both computers and mobile devices? Or create a mobile version? And how will you test your mobile site on various mobile devices? If your head is spinning at the thought of all this extra work, then why not work with a tailored business kit that can make things easier for you?

iClew can help you build your mobile site with tailored recommendations and guidance that will rocket you to the top of the market. We can help you set up a responsive website that switches from computers to mobile devices with ease.

Instead, use the iClew business kit to help you better manage the nitty-gritty details of maintaining your website.
